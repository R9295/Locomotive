#What is Locomotive:
Locomotive is an open-source, event-driven, carpooling service for the community of Auroville. Locomotive will provide event data that will allow users to browse events happening in and around Auroville. They'll be provided a list of Locomotive users attending the event. Users can contact each other and travel together to encourage safe transport to and fro from events.
